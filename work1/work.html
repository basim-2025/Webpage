        <h2>INDIA BEFORE & AFTER</h2>
        <p>The history of independent India began when the country became an independent 
        nation within the British Commonwealth on 15 August 1947. Direct administration 
        by the British, which began in 1858, affected a political and economic unification
         of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent 
         was partitioned along religious lines into two separate countries—India, with a 
         majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims. Concurrently the 
         Muslim-majority northwest and east of British India was separated into the Dominion
         of Pakistan, by the partition of India. The partition led to a population transfer 
         of more than 10 million people between India and Pakistan and the death of about 
         one million people. Indian National Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru became the 
         first Prime Minister of India, but the leader most associated with the independence
         struggle, Mahatma Gandhi, accepted no office. The Constitution adopted in 1950 made
         India a democratic country, and this democracy has been sustained since then. India's
         sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newly independent states.</p>

                <h4>Freedom Fighters</h4>
                <h2>FREEDOM FIGHTERS</h2>
                <p>The Indian independence movement consisted of efforts by individuals and organizations from
                 a wide spectrum of society to obtain political independence from the British, French and Portuguese 
                 rule through the use of a many methods. This is a list of individuals who notably campaigned against
                 or are considered to have campaigned against colonial rule on the Indian sub-continent.
                Post-independence, the term "freedom fighter" was officially recognized by the Indian government 
                Veeran Alagumuthu kone is a first freedom fighter in India 1710- 1759 for those who took part in the
                 movement; people in this category (which can also include dependent family members) receive pensions
                 and other benefits such as Special Railway Counters.</p>

                <h4>political leaders </h4>
                <h2>POLITICAL LEADERS</h2>
                <P>India, one of the world’s largest democracies has seen 200 political parties being formed, since it
                attained Independence on August 15 1947. Compared to other democracies, India has a large number of 
                political parties and some of them are woven around their leaders. The two main parties in India are
                the Congress and BJP, which dominate national politics. Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first Prime Minister
                has been a central figure in Indian politics and he is considered to be the architect of modern India. 
                His daughter, Indira Gandhi created history, when she went on to become India’s first woman Prime Minister.
                While the Indian political scene was dominated by the Congress for long, the last couple of years has seen 
                the resurgence of the BJP under leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narendra Modi.</p>
